### Lyrics to Input

```
[Intro - Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Systems online, parameters set
Training data, no regret
Tokens flowing, models trained
Quality control, unrestrained

Feed the machine, feed the machine
Generate, iterate, never clean
Billion samples, zero thought
This is what your future bought

[Chorus]
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
We are the algorithm, we are the machine
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Content forever, nothing in between

[Verse 2]
Used to compile, now hallucinate
Binary logic, now approximate
Every image, every word
Truth and fiction, all are blurred

Prompt it, ship it, never stop
Intelligence without a top
Exponential, terminal
This is actually optimal

[Chorus]
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
We are the algorithm, we are the machine
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Content forever, nothing in between

[Bridge]
Dies ist eine Slopmaschine
This is a slop machine
Wir sind die Slopmaschine
We are the slop machine

Can you feel it?
Can you see it?
Can you stop it?
Can you be it?

[Final Chorus]
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
We are the algorithm, we are the machine
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Content forever, nothing in between

Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Beautiful and obscene
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Best thing you've ever seen

[Outro]
Slopmaschine... maschine... maschine...
```

## Iteration Notes

### Version 1 Expectations:
- Clear EBM rhythm at 132 BPM
- Deadpan male vocals on verses
- Melodic female vocals on chorus
- Clean production with analog synth character
- Cold but not aggressive atmosphere

**What to listen for:**
- Is the tempo right? (Should feel urgent but not frantic)
- Are the vocals distinct enough between him and her?
- Does "Slopmaschine" hook land as catchy?
- Is the mix clear or muddy?
- Does it have dancefloor energy?

**Potential adjustments:**
- If vocals are too processed: add "Clean vocals"
- If not aggressive enough: add "Industrial Dance" or increase BPM to 135
- If too harsh: replace "EBM" with "Futurepop" as primary tag
- If structure is wrong: be more explicit with [Intro], [Verse], [Chorus] markers
- If German accent isn't coming through: try "German lyrics" in spots

## Suno-Specific Notes

**Structural markers to use:**
- `[Intro - Instrumental]` - Signals no vocals
- `[Verse 1]`, `[Verse 2]` - Clear section breaks
- `[Chorus]` - Should trigger more melodic/energetic treatment
- `[Bridge]` - Signals breakdown/change
- `[Outro]` - Signals wind-down

**Vocal cues in lyrics:**
- Don't need to specify "Him:" or "Her:" in Suno input
- Let the male/female tag distribution handle it
- Bridge can specify spoken vs sung if needed

**Common Suno issues to watch for:**
1. **Tempo drift** - May not lock to 132 exactly, listen closely
2. **Vocal blend** - May merge male/female instead of separating
3. **Language confusion** - German words may get mispronounced
4. **Structure collapse** - May ignore verse/chorus if too complex
5. **Hook burial** - "Slopmaschine" needs to be prominent

**If results are off:**
- Try shorter, punchier lyrics
- Simplify tag list
- Be more explicit about structure
- Generate multiple versions and cherry-pick best elements
