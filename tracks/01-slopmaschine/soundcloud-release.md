## Follow-Up Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Monitor comments, engage
- Share listener reactions (if any good ones)
- Post Instagram stories with SoundCloud stats

**Week 2-3:**
- Start teasing "stems version" or "V2"
- Behind-the-scenes content (prompt iterations, takes)
- Build toward music video release

**Month 2:**
- Release stems-merged version as "SLOPMASCHINE (Final)" or "V2"
- Music video drop
- Consider Spotify/Apple Music with AI disclosure

---

## Notes

- SoundCloud is the most permissive platform for AI music
- Underground/experimental positioning fits EBM aesthetic
- You can always release a "final" version later on other platforms
- The AI disclosure is required and thematically appropriate
- Embrace the transparency - it's the concept
