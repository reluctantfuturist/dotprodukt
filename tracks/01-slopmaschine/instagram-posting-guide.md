## Optional: Instagram Story

After posting to feed, you can ALSO post a Story for more immediate reach:

### Story Option 1: Audio Snippet
1. Create 15-30 second audio clip from Slopmaschine
2. Post as Story with audio waveform or static image
3. Add Link Sticker pointing to SoundCloud
4. Add text: "SLOPMASCHINE 🏭 OUT NOW"

### Story Option 2: Repost Feed Post
1. Go to your new feed post
2. Tap the paper airplane icon (share)
3. "Add post to story"
4. Add Link Sticker to SoundCloud
5. Post

**My recommendation:** Do BOTH - Feed post (permanent) + Story (temporary urgency)

---

## Timing Recommendation

**If Post 1 was posted today (Feb 5):**

**Option A: Post immediately** (6+ hours after Post 1)
- Shows momentum
- Gets music out there
- People who followed from Post 1 get notified

**Option B: Wait until tomorrow** (Feb 6)
- Gives Post 1 time to breathe
- Two-day rollout feels more intentional
- Build anticipation

**My vote:** Post tonight or tomorrow morning. Don't wait too long - momentum matters.

## After Posting

### Engagement Strategy

**Pin a comment on the post:**
```
Dies ist eine Slopmaschine. 🏭
```

**Reply to comments:**
- Stay in character (deadpan, observational)
- Don't over-explain
- "The machine continues."
- "Processing."
- Minimal but present

**Monitor:**
- Comments (engage within 24 hours)
- DMs (respond to genuine inquiries)
- Shares/saves (note what resonates)

---

## Next Steps (Week 1-2)

**Day 3-4:**
- Share listener reactions (if any)
- Behind-the-scenes Story content (prompt iterations, takes)

**Week 2:**
- Tease music video or V2 of track
- More character content (Der Prozessor/Die Störung individual posts)

**Week 3-4:**
- Music video release
- Consider extending to other platforms (Spotify with AI disclosure)

## Important Notes
