# Higgsfield Video Prompts - Character Tests

## Setup Notes

- **Method:** Image-to-Video (upload character images as Start Frame)
- **Duration:** Start with 10 seconds for testing
- **Style:** Cinematic, high contrast, 1990s electronic music video aesthetic
- **Motion Level:** Minimal to Medium (EBM performance = controlled, not hyperactive)

## Der Prozessor (Him) - Image-to-Video Prompt

**Source Image:** `Der_Prozessor_2.png`

### Higgsfield Prompt:
```
Man standing still in industrial warehouse, minimal movement, deadpan
emotionless expression maintained, slight breathing motion only, cold
blue factory lighting, high contrast shadows, slow camera push-in,
professional cinematography, 1990s EBM music video aesthetic, German
electronic body music, stoic presence, brutalist concrete background,
observational gaze, minimal performance, machine-like stillness
```

### Camera Settings:
- **Camera Movement:** Slow Push In (start wide, slowly push to medium close-up)
- **Motion Intensity:** Low (10-20%) - he barely moves
- **Style Preset:** Cinematic / Industrial

### Expected Result:
- Camera slowly pushes in on static figure
- Minimal breathing/micro-movements
- Expression never changes (blank, observational)
- Cold blue lighting remains consistent
- Background has subtle motion (atmospheric, industrial)
- 10 seconds of "observing the machine"

### Alternative Camera Options to Test:
- **Static Camera** - No movement, just him existing
- **Slow Orbit** - Camera slowly circles around him (he doesn't move)
- **Slight Tilt Up** - Start at chest, slowly tilt up to face

## Die Störung (Her) - Image-to-Video Prompt

**Source Image:** `Die_Störung_1.png`

### Higgsfield Prompt:
```
Woman in industrial warehouse, subtle knowing smile, slight head tilt
or movement, confident presence, warm orange amber lighting in background
contrasting with cold blue foreground, atmospheric mood, professional
cinematography, 1990s futurepop music video aesthetic, German electronic
music, layered textured clothing, dynamic but controlled movement,
embracing the chaos, alive and engaged expression, slight hair movement
```

### Camera Settings:
- **Camera Movement:** Slow Push In or Tracking Shot
- **Motion Intensity:** Medium (30-40%) - more dynamic than Der Prozessor
- **Style Preset:** Cinematic / Moody

### Expected Result:
- More movement than Der Prozessor but still controlled
- Slight head tilt, knowing smile maintained or intensified
- Hair moves slightly (wind, atmosphere)
- Warm/cold lighting contrast remains
- Background has more activity (sparks, atmosphere, industrial motion)
- 10 seconds of "participating in the machine"

### Alternative Camera Options to Test:
- **Slow Tracking Left/Right** - Camera slides past her, she follows with eyes
- **Push In with Slight Orbit** - Combines movement types
- **Dutch Angle Tilt** - Slight off-kilter framing (chaos principle)

## Duo Shot - If Testing Together

### Higgsfield Prompt:
```
Two figures in industrial warehouse, man and woman standing apart,
minimal movement from man (left), subtle dynamic movement from woman (right),
cold blue lighting on man's side, warm orange amber lighting on woman's side,
high contrast cinematography, 1990s electronic music video aesthetic,
EBM performance, opposing energies, order versus chaos, professional
cinematography, brutalist industrial setting, atmospheric
```

### Camera Settings:
- **Camera Movement:** Slow Push In on both, or Slow Pan from him to her
- **Motion Intensity:** Split (low on him, medium on her)
- **Style Preset:** Cinematic / High Contrast

## Scene-Specific Prompts (Based on Music Video Concept)

### Verse 1 - Him Observes (0:16-0:45)
```
Man observing factory machinery, deadpan expression, standing completely
still, industrial assembly line in motion behind him, cold blue lighting,
high contrast shadows, locked-off camera slow push-in, 1990s industrial
music video, German EBM aesthetic, observational presence, mechanical
precision in background
```

**Camera:** Slow Push In
**Duration:** 10 seconds (loop/extend for full verse)

---

### Chorus 1 - Her Emerges (0:45-1:15)
```
Woman emerging through digital glitch layers, knowing smile, confident
movement, warm amber lighting breaking into cold blue tones, industrial
warehouse with atmospheric effects, neural network visualizations in
background, 1990s futurepop aesthetic, German electronic music, embracing
chaos, dynamic presence, textured layered appearance
```

**Camera:** Push In with Slight Orbit
**Duration:** 10 seconds (loop/extend for full chorus)

---

### Bridge - Tension (2:15-2:45)
```
Two figures in darkness, minimal lighting, silhouettes, very subtle
movement, processing visualization in background, tension building,
negative space, cold ambient light, slow camera push-in, industrial
minimalism, waiting aesthetic, system thinking, atmospheric darkness
```

**Camera:** Very Slow Push In
**Duration:** 10 seconds (loop/extend for bridge)

## General Higgsfield Tips

### For Der Prozessor:
- Keep motion at 10-20% maximum
- Lock the expression (emotionless, blank)
- Camera does the work, not the character
- Think "security camera footage of a sentient machine"

### For Die Störung:
- Motion can be 30-40%
- Allow slight expression changes (smile intensifies)
- She can respond to camera movement
- Think "performance, but controlled chaos"

### Technical Settings:
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum (4K if available)
- **Frame Rate:** 24fps or 30fps (cinematic vs smooth)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (standard) or 2.39:1 (ultra-cinematic)
- **Color Grading:** High contrast, desaturated with color pops

### Post-Processing Notes:
- May need to color grade further (cold blue for him, warm/cold split for her)
- Audio sync in editing (export stems from Suno)
- Can loop/extend clips for longer sections
- Add glitch effects in post for her sections if needed

## Testing Workflow

1. **Start with 10-second tests** of each character
2. **Test different camera movements** (Push In, Orbit, Static, Tracking)
3. **Adjust motion intensity** (too much = not EBM, too little = boring)
4. **Lock in the winning combo** for each character
5. **Generate longer clips** (30-60 seconds) once dialed in
6. **Create scene-specific variations** based on music video concept

## Success Criteria

**Der Prozessor works if:**
- He's almost unsettlingly still
- Expression never breaks
- Camera movement creates all the dynamism
- You feel like you're observing a machine

**Die Störung works if:**
- She's alive but controlled
- Smile/expression has personality
- Movement is purposeful, not random
- She feels like the opposite of him (chaos vs order)

**The duo works if:**
- Visual contrast is clear (lighting, energy, movement)
- They feel like two parts of the same machine
- EBM aesthetic is maintained (precision, not performance)
- You can imagine them making "Slopmaschine"
