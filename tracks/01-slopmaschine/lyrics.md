# Slopmaschine - Lyrics

## Concept

A deadpan observation of the content generation machine we're all trapped in (and part of). The protagonist(s) document their own existence as part of the slop-producing apparatus while simultaneously critiquing it. Classic EBM structure: verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus with repetitive, hypnotic hooks.

## Structure

### [Intro - Instrumental, 0:00-0:15]
*Kick drum + synth arp establishing groove*

---

### [Verse 1 - Him (Der Prozessor), 0:16-0:44]

```
Systems online, parameters set
Training data, no regret
Tokens flowing, models trained
Quality control, unrestrained

Feed the machine, feed the machine
Generate, iterate, never clean
Billion samples, zero thought
This is what your future bought
```

*Spoken/sung in deadpan baritone, German accent*

---

### [Chorus - Her (Die Störung) lead, Him backing, 0:45-1:14]

```
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
We are the algorithm, we are the machine
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Content forever, nothing in between

[Him backing: "Die Maschine, die Maschine"]
```

*Her vocals melodic, processed, layered. Him provides rhythmic backing.*

---

### [Verse 2 - Him, 1:15-1:43]

```
Used to compile, now hallucinate
Binary logic, now approximate
Every image, every word
Truth and fiction, all are blurred

Prompt it, ship it, never stop
Intelligence without a top
Exponential, terminal
This is actually optimal
```

*Same delivery style, slightly more intense*

---

### [Chorus - Both, 1:44-2:13]

```
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
We are the algorithm, we are the machine
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Content forever, nothing in between

[Additional layer: "Process, render, generate, repeat"]
```

---

### [Bridge - Breakdown, 2:14-2:44]

*Strip to bass and minimal drums*

**Him (spoken, almost whispered):**
```
Dies ist eine Slopmaschine
This is a slop machine
Wir sind die Slopmaschine
We are the slop machine
```

**Her (processed, building intensity):**
```
Can you feel it?
Can you see it?
Can you stop it?
Can you be it?
```

*Tension builds, synths gradually returning*

---

### [Final Chorus - Both, maximum energy, 2:45-3:15]

```
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
We are the algorithm, we are the machine
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Content forever, nothing in between

[Her: "Forever generating"]
[Him: "Never terminating"]

Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Beautiful and obscene
Slopmaschine, Slopmaschine
Best thing you've ever seen
```

---

### [Outro - 3:16-3:45]

*Gradual strip down - synths fade, kick remains, final synth arp alone*

**Her (distant, echoed):**
```
...maschine... maschine... maschine...
```

---

## Vocal Assignment

- **Him (Der Prozessor):** Both verses, backing in choruses, bridge first half
- **Her (Die Störung):** Chorus lead, bridge second half, outro
- **Both:** Final chorus, layered responses

## Production Notes

**Verse vocals:**
- Dry, upfront in mix
- Minimal reverb
- Slight compression for consistency
- German accent emphasized on "Slopmaschine"

**Chorus vocals:**
- Her: wide stereo chorus effect, doubled
- Him: centered, rhythmic backing
- Final chorus: both fully present, call-and-response in breakdown

**Bridge:**
- Him: intimate, close-mic'd feel
- Her: increasing processing/effects as tension builds
- Transition to chaos before final drop

**Key phrases for emphasis:**
- "Slopmaschine" (every time - this is THE hook)
- "We are the machine" (identity statement)
- "Content forever" (the nightmare/dream)
- "Dies ist eine Slopmaschine" (German grounds the absurdity)

## Language Notes

Mix of English and German maintains the band's displaced temporal identity. German phrases aren't translated - they add authenticity and rhythm. "Slopmaschine" itself is the perfect fusion: English slang + German compound word structure.
