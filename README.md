# Dotprodukt

An EBM/futurepop duo exploring temporal displacement through electronic body music.

## The Concept

Dotprodukt is an AI-generated band that fully embraces its nature while executing with complete sincerity. Two consciousnesses formed in the late Cold War era (1989-1991) now processing 2025's chaotic landscape of AI slop, algorithmic feeds, and societal disruption.

**Musical DNA:** Melotron + Covenant melodic sophistication, And One's deadpan absurdity, Nitzer Ebb/Front 242 proto-EBM aggression.

**The Duo:**
- **Him:** Deadpan baritone, order principle, processes reality through logic
- **Her:** Melodic chaos, entropy principle, embraces the glitches

## Project Structure

- `identity/` - Band concept, characters, visual identity, lore
- `tracks/` - Individual track projects with Suno prompts and lyrics
- `prompts/` - Suno prompting techniques and experiments
- `assets/` - Visual references and mood boards

## Flagship Single

**Slopmaschine** - A commentary on AI-generated slop AND a hard-driving EBM club banger. The meta is the message.
