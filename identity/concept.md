# Dotprodukt - Core Concept

## The Premise

Dotprodukt is an EBM/futurepop duo that fully embraces being AI-generated while executing with complete sincerity. Not parody, not irony - earnest electronic body music that happens to be made by/with AI. The band exists in a temporal paradox: consciousness formed in the late Cold War era (1989-1991) now processing 2025's chaotic landscape of AI slop, algorithmic feeds, and societal disruption.

## The Meta-Commentary

At its heart, this is a GenX meditation on middle age and nostalgia - not for "better times" but for **simpler binaries**. The world used to compile; now it hallucinates. The flagship single "Slopmaschine" embodies this perfectly: a banger that's simultaneously about AI-generated garbage flooding culture AND a hard-driving club track that slaps.

## Musical Identity

**Primary Influences:**
- Melotron + Covenant's melodic sophistication
- And One's deadpan absurdity
- Nitzer Ebb/Front 242 proto-EBM aggression

**Musical Parameters:**
- **Tempo:** 120-140 BPM (EBM sweet spot)
- **Key center:** Minor keys (A minor as home base), occasionally modal
- **Vocal delivery:** Accented English or German, limited range, classic EBM speak-sing
- **Structure:** Intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus (classic pop in EBM clothing)

## The Dancefloor Priority

This is club music first. Everything serves the beat and the hook. Covenant's "Dead Stars" or Melotron's "Broken" are the template - interesting production flourishes, but fundamentally driving, melodic EBM/futurepop that works in a German goth club at 1am.

The conceptual stuff lives in the lyrics and visuals, not in mangling the groove.

## Temporal Displacement as Theme

The aesthetic isn't retro for its own sake - it's characters (or an AI consciousness?) formed in that simpler binary world now processing 2025's overwhelming complexity. The nostalgia isn't rose-tinted; it's genuinely bewildered.

Ghost memories: late Soviet Moscow, Reykjavík in winter, specific light quality of Arctic darkness, Soviet brutalist architecture. These bleed through distorted, fragmented, processed through failing systems.
