# Visual Identity

## Core Aesthetic: "Temporal Displacement"

The visual language reflects consciousnesses formed in 1989-1991 trying to render 2025. Think Amiga 500 trying to process a diffusion model. Modern AI chaos breaking through clean geometric late-80s computer graphics. Order slowly corrupting into entropy.

## Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
- CGA/EGA limited palette - stark cyan, magenta, black, white
- That specific late-80s blue (IBM blue, Windows 3.1 blue)
- High contrast, limited palette

**Accent Colors:**
- Shocking pinks, yellows (her colors - Pippi Longstocking meets cybergoth)
- RGB channel split colors (chromatic aberration)

**Corruption Effects:**
- JPEG artifacts and compression noise
- Color banding and posterization
- Encoding errors and digital decay

## Typography

**Band Name (Dotprodukt):**
- Geometric sans-serif, tight kerning
- Eurostile, Bank Gothic, similar technical fonts
- **No umlauts** - keeping it clean and mathematical

**Body Text:**
- Monospace terminal fonts (Courier, IBM VGA font)
- Fixed-width, technical readability

**Glitch Text:**
- Zalgo corruption, Unicode breaks
- Encoding errors, misrendered characters
- Used sparingly for effect

## Visual Elements

**Retro-Computing Layer:**
- Early 3D raytracing renders (chrome spheres, checkerboard planes)
- Wireframe meshes partially failing to render
- CRT scanlines and phosphor bloom
- VHS tracking errors and tape degradation
- Old computer lab aesthetics: beige towers, tangled cables, floppy disk textures

**AI/Modern Layer:**
- Neural network hallucinations
- Misaligned features, uncanny valley artifacts
- Training data visualization (gradient flows, latent space)
- Failed AI renders, partial generations

**Physical Memory Layer:**
- Concrete brutalist architecture (East Germany, late Soviet)
- Arctic winter light quality (Reykjavík)
- Late Soviet Moscow textures and spaces
- These appear distorted, processed, barely recognizable
- Real-world bleeding through as corrupted patterns

## Design Principles

1. **Functional first** - readability and clarity trump effects
2. **Earned corruption** - glitches are intentional, not random
3. **Temporal collision** - 1989 aesthetics colliding with 2025 chaos
4. **Cold precision** - even chaos is systematic
5. **No nostalgia filter** - the past wasn't better, just simpler

## Mood Board Keywords

Amiga demos, early raytracing, CRT phosphor, VHS artifacts, Soviet brutalism, Arctic winter, Berlin wall fall, Y2K aesthetics, AI training visualization, failed renders, encoding errors, concrete textures, analog synth panels, computer lab lighting
