# Suno Prompting Guide for Dotprodukt

## The Challenge

Suno needs specific genre tags and style cues to hit the EBM/futurepop aesthetic. The trick is balancing specificity (to avoid generic synthpop) while not confusing it with too many references.

## Effective Genre Tags

**Primary Tags (Always Use):**
- `EBM` - Core identifier
- `Futurepop` - When going melodic
- `Dark Electro` - When going harder

**Secondary Tags (Use Carefully):**
- `Synthpop` - Can make it too soft, use sparingly
- `Industrial Dance` - Occasionally, for aggression

**Avoid These:**
- `Darkwave` - Too slow/atmospheric, wrong vibe
- `Synth-wave` - Wrong era aesthetic (80s nostalgia, not displacement)
- `EDM` - Too modern/mainstream production

## Vocal Direction

**Him (Der Prozessor):**
- `Male baritone vocals`
- `German accent` or `German-accented English`
- `Deadpan delivery`
- `Speak-singing style` or `Half-spoken vocals`
- `Minimal vibrato`
- `Robotic delivery` (use carefully, can sound too processed)

**Her (Die Störung):**
- `Female backing vocals`
- `Melodic chorus`
- `Layered harmonies`
- `Processed vocals` (when you want effects)
- Note: Let her personality come through in lyrics/delivery rather than over-tagging

**Avoid:**
- `Emotional vocals` - Wrong energy
- `Powerful vocals` - Too theatrical
- `Aggressive vocals` - This isn't metal

## Production Style

**Core Sound:**
- `Analog synthesizers`
- `Driving bassline`
- `Punchy drums`
- `Clean production` - Prevents over-distortion
- `Tight production` - Keeps it precise

**Tempo:**
- `120 BPM` to `140 BPM` - Specify the range or exact tempo
- EBM sweet spot is 125-135 BPM

**Atmosphere (Use Sparingly):**
- `Cold atmosphere`
- `Mechanical precision`
- `European club sound`
- Don't overload - 1-2 atmospheric tags max

## Song Structure Tags

- `Verse-chorus structure`
- `Melodic hooks`
- `Extended intro` - For club mix feel
- `Instrumental breakdown` - Mid-track breakdown

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't over-tag** - More than 8-10 tags confuses Suno
2. **Don't mix incompatible genres** - EBM + Techno = confusion
3. **Don't ask for specific artists** - Reference genres/styles instead
4. **Don't overspecify production** - Let Suno interpret some things
5. **Don't forget tempo** - Critical for getting EBM energy right

## Effective Prompt Formula

```
[Genre tags: 2-3 core] + [Vocal style: 2-3 tags] + [Production: 2-3 tags] + [Tempo] + [Atmosphere: 1-2 tags]
```

**Example:**
```
EBM, Futurepop, Male baritone vocals with German accent, Deadpan delivery, Analog synthesizers, Driving bassline, 130 BPM, Cold atmosphere
```

## Testing Strategy

1. Start with minimal tags (4-5 core tags)
2. Generate, listen, identify what's wrong
3. Add 1-2 corrective tags
4. Iterate - but if more than 10 tags, remove rather than add

## Lyrical Approach

- Write lyrics separately, don't rely on Suno generation
- Keep lines short and rhythmic (EBM is about cadence)
- Repetition is your friend (choruses should be earworms)
- Leave space for instrumental sections
- His parts: deadpan observations, short declarative statements
- Her parts: melodic hooks, can be more abstract/emotional
