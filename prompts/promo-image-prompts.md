# Dotprodukt Promo Image Prompts

Combining Der Prozessor and Die Störung into promotional band photography.

## Concept Direction

**Visual Theme:** Order vs Entropy, Precision vs Chaos, Cold vs Warm
**Aesthetic:** 1990s EBM/futurepop band photography, industrial minimalism
**Key Contrast:** Him (deadpan, cold blue, still) vs Her (knowing, warm/cold, alive)

---

## Option 1: Side-by-Side Split (Recommended)

### Nano Banana Prompt:
```
Promotional band photograph, two figures side by side in industrial warehouse,
man on left wearing black turtleneck with deadpan emotionless expression,
woman on right with auburn hair and knowing smile wearing leather jacket,
split lighting design with cold blue light on left side and warm amber orange
light breaking into cold blue on right side, high contrast cinematography,
brutalist concrete industrial background, 1990s electronic music band photo,
German EBM futurepop aesthetic, professional photography, moody atmospheric,
order versus chaos visual concept, precision meets entropy, both looking
directly at camera, horizontal composition
```

**Composition Notes:**
- Clear vertical division between them (visual split)
- Cold blue dominates his side, warm/cold mix on her side
- Both face camera but maintain distinct energy
- Industrial background unified but lighting separates them

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (horizontal promo banner) or 4:5 (Instagram post)

---

## Option 2: Depth Composition (Him Front, Her Back)

### Nano Banana Prompt:
```
Promotional band photograph, man in foreground wearing black turtleneck with
deadpan emotionless expression looking directly at camera, woman in background
with auburn hair and knowing smile slightly out of focus, industrial warehouse
setting, cold blue lighting in foreground transitioning to warm amber lighting
in background, brutalist concrete walls, 1990s electronic music aesthetic,
German EBM band photography, high contrast moody atmosphere, professional
cinematography, depth of field composition, order in focus chaos in background
```

**Composition Notes:**
- Der Prozessor sharp focus foreground (order, precision)
- Die Störung slightly soft focus background (chaos, entropy)
- Lighting transition from cold (front) to warm (back)
- Creates hierarchy: he observes, she operates in the background

**Aspect Ratio:** 3:4 (vertical poster) or 1:1 (square album art)

---

## Option 3: Facing Each Other Profile

### Nano Banana Prompt:
```
Promotional band photograph, man and woman facing each other in profile,
industrial warehouse setting between them, man on left wearing black turtleneck
with deadpan expression, woman on right with auburn hair and knowing smile
wearing leather jacket, cold blue light from left, warm amber light from right,
lights meeting in center creating visual tension, brutalist concrete background,
1990s electronic music band photography, German EBM aesthetic, high contrast
atmospheric, professional cinematography, order versus chaos confrontation,
horizontal composition
```

**Composition Notes:**
- They face each other, not the camera (confrontation/dialogue)
- Lighting comes from opposite sides, meets in middle
- Visual tension in the center space between them
- Suggests relationship/interaction between order and chaos

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (horizontal banner) or 2.39:1 (ultra-wide cinematic)

---

## Option 4: Back-to-Back

### Nano Banana Prompt:
```
Promotional band photograph, man and woman standing back to back in industrial
warehouse, man wearing black turtleneck with profile view showing deadpan
expression, woman with auburn hair showing knowing smile in profile, both
looking opposite directions, cold blue lighting on one side and warm amber
lighting on other side meeting in center, brutalist concrete setting, 1990s
electronic music band aesthetic, German EBM photography, high contrast moody
atmosphere, professional cinematography, order and chaos as two sides of same
machine, vertical composition
```

**Composition Notes:**
- Back-to-back suggests unity but opposition
- Both look outward in different directions
- Lighting wraps around them from opposite sides
- "Two parts of the same machine" visual metaphor

**Aspect Ratio:** 3:4 (vertical) or 2:3 (poster)

---

## Option 5: The Slopmaschine (Literal)

### Nano Banana Prompt:
```
Promotional band photograph, two figures in industrial factory with assembly
line machinery between them, man on left wearing black turtleneck observing
with deadpan expression, woman on right with auburn hair and knowing smile
engaged with the machine, cold blue factory lighting with warm amber accents,
brutalist industrial setting, conveyor belt system in center, 1990s electronic
music aesthetic, German EBM band photography, high contrast cinematography,
the machine between them generating content, professional moody atmosphere,
order observing chaos creating, horizontal composition
```

**Composition Notes:**
- The Slopmaschine (literal factory) between them
- He observes, she participates
- Machine/assembly line as visual metaphor
- Most literal interpretation of the band concept

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (horizontal) or 21:9 (ultra-wide)

---

## Option 6: Minimalist Duo (Kraftwerk Homage)

### Nano Banana Prompt:
```
Minimalist promotional band photograph, two figures standing side by side
against plain brutalist concrete wall, man wearing black turtleneck with
completely emotionless expression, woman with auburn hair and subtle knowing
smile wearing dark clothing, even cold lighting with slight warm accent on
her side, extreme minimalism, 1970s Kraftwerk meets 1990s EBM aesthetic,
German electronic music band photography, high contrast black and white with
color temperature differences, professional studio photography, order and
chaos in minimal composition, both looking directly at camera, vertical or
horizontal composition
```

**Composition Notes:**
- Strip away everything except the two figures
- Kraftwerk-style minimalism (the band IS the concept)
- Subtle lighting differences create all the contrast
- Most "serious band photo" option

**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square album art) or 4:5 (Instagram)

---

## Recommended Approach

**Start with Option 1 (Side-by-Side Split)** because:
1. Clear visual contrast (lighting, energy, expression)
2. Both characters equally present
3. Works across multiple aspect ratios
4. Most versatile for different uses (social media, press, banners)
5. Immediately communicates the duo's opposing natures

**Then try Option 5 (The Slopmaschine)** because:
1. Most thematically on-brand
2. Literal visualization of the band concept
3. Unique, memorable composition
4. Works great for flagship single promo

## Technical Specs for All Options

### Color Palette:
- **Him:** Cold blue (#1a1f2e, #2d3e50), high contrast shadows
- **Her:** Warm amber (#f4a300, #ff8800) breaking into cold blue
- **Background:** Desaturated concrete, industrial gray
- **Accent:** Warning yellow/orange for machine elements

### Lighting Notes:
- High contrast (deep shadows, bright highlights)
- Cold vs warm as primary visual distinction
- Atmospheric (haze, industrial atmosphere)
- Professional studio quality but industrial setting

### Post-Processing:
- Increase contrast
- Desaturate slightly (except for color temperature differences)
- Sharpen for industrial edge
- Vignette subtle on edges

### Typography Overlay (if needed):
```

## Iteration Tips

1. **Generate base composition** without text first
2. **Test multiple aspect ratios** for different use cases
3. **Adjust lighting balance** (may need to emphasize warm/cold split more)
4. **Check character consistency** with reference images
5. **Add typography** in post if needed (Photoshop, Figma, etc.)

## Use Cases

- **16:9 Horizontal:** YouTube banner, website header, press kit
- **1:1 Square:** Instagram post, album art, profile picture
- **4:5 Vertical:** Instagram story, mobile-first promo
- **3:4 Portrait:** Poster, print promo, Spotify canvas
- **21:9 Ultra-wide:** Desktop wallpaper, premium press image

## Success Criteria

The promo image works if:
1. You immediately understand they're opposites
2. The industrial/EBM aesthetic is clear
3. Their individual characters are maintained
4. It looks like a real band photo, not AI slop (irony noted)
5. You want to hear what "Slopmaschine" sounds like
