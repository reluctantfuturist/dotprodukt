# Suno Stems Guide

## Overview

Suno Studio is a web-based Generative Audio Workstation with a multitrack interface that allows you to layer, arrange, edit, extract stems, record audio, and adjust tempo with complete creative control.

## Stem Separation & Extraction

### Automatic Stem Splitting

Suno automatically splits generated songs into individual components:
- **Vocals** (separate male/female if present)
- **Bass**
- **Drums**
- **Guitars**
- **Synths**
- **Other instruments**

Any audio that you import or generate can be split into stems to work on further with a DAW-like workflow.

### Export Options

- **12-stem exports** available
- Download individual tracks/stems as separate files
- Export MIDI parts from stems to refine in other DAWs (Logic Pro, etc.)
- Multitrack export downloads all tracks separately

## Generative Stems

One of the most innovative features: **create new stems from text prompts** that are contextually aware of existing project audio.

### Use Cases:
- Generate entirely new instrument parts (trumpet, guitar, drums, etc.) inside an existing track
- Create stems that automatically fit your song's rhythm and style
- Add elements that are missing from the original generation
- Fill gaps or create variations

## Editing Capabilities

### Basic Controls:
- Volume adjustment per stem
- Panning per stem
- 6-band EQ for further shaping
- Mute/solo individual stems
- Drag sections around
- Extend chorus or cut bridges

### Arrangement:
- Rearrange any track
- Cut, copy, paste sections
- Build custom arrangements from generated material

## Workflow for Dotprodukt

### Cherry-Picking Best Elements:

1. **Generate multiple takes** (Suno gives 2 versions per prompt)
2. **Export stems** from each take
3. **Compare elements:**
   - Take vocal performances you like from one version
   - Combine with instrumental elements from another
   - Use generative stems to fill gaps

4. **Example for Slopmaschine:**
   - Export stems from Take 1.1 (great female vocals, solid chorus)
   - Export stems from Take 1.2 (interesting vocal interplay, strong male moments)
   - Mix and match the best elements
   - Generate additional elements if needed

### Advanced Techniques:

- **Layer vocals** from different takes for thickness
- **Create transitions** between different versions
- **Extend sections** that work particularly well
- **Generate contextual fills** for bridges or breakdowns
- **Export to DAW** for final mixing and mastering

## Tips for Dotprodukt

- **Embrace the chaos** - stems let you control what was random
- **Character consistency** - match Der Prozessor and Die Störung vocal characteristics across takes
- **Maintain the aesthetic** - even when mixing, preserve the "intentionally generic" EBM sound
- **Document everything** - track which stems came from which take for future reference
