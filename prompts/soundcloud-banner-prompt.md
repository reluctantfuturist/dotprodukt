## Option 1: Industrial Landscape with Text (Recommended)

```
Ultra-wide panoramic industrial factory interior, brutalist concrete warehouse,
cold blue lighting from left transitioning to warm amber lighting on right,
assembly line machinery, atmospheric haze, high contrast cinematography,
1990s electronic music aesthetic, "DOTPRODUKT" text in large geometric font
(Eurostile style) on left side, minimal composition, professional banner design,
2480x520 pixel format, German EBM aesthetic, moody industrial atmosphere
```

**Why:** Full industrial atmosphere, establishes brand with text, lighting split mirrors the duo concept.

## Option 2: Character Silhouettes

```
Ultra-wide industrial warehouse banner, two silhouetted figures far apart on
opposite sides of frame, man on left in cold blue light, woman on right in
warm amber light, brutalist concrete setting, factory machinery between them,
high contrast, atmospheric, minimal composition, 1990s EBM aesthetic, very
wide horizontal format 2480x520 pixels, moody cinematic lighting, negative
space in center
```

**Why:** Visual representation of Der Prozessor × Die Störung, space between = tension.

---

## Option 3: Pure Industrial (No People, No Text)

```
Ultra-wide panoramic view of industrial factory floor, assembly line conveyor
system, brutalist architecture, cold blue and warm amber lighting gradient
across the space, atmospheric industrial haze, high contrast shadows, geometric
machinery, 1990s photography aesthetic, professional banner composition,
2480x520 pixel ultra-wide format, German industrial design, moody atmospheric
```

**Why:** Pure aesthetic, let the visuals speak. Very Kraftwerk.

## Option 4: Abstract Geometric Pattern

```
Ultra-wide geometric pattern banner, industrial assembly line abstracted into
geometric shapes, circuit board meets factory floor, cold blue and warm amber
color scheme, high contrast, symmetrical composition with central focus point,
brutalist technical design, 1990s computer graphics aesthetic, 2480x520 pixel
format, minimal and precise, EBM visual identity
```

**Why:** More abstract, pattern-based, could be unique/memorable.

---

## Option 5: Text-Focused Minimal

```
Ultra-wide banner, dark industrial concrete texture background, cold blue
gradient, "DOTPRODUKT" in large geometric font (Eurostile/Bank Gothic style)
positioned left-of-center, "EBM/FUTUREPOP | 1989→2025" in smaller font on
right side, factory icon or gear symbol, minimal composition, high contrast
white text on dark background, professional music banner, 2480x520 pixels,
brutalist aesthetic
```

**Why:** Clear branding, minimal, works at any size, very readable.

## Technical Notes

**Key Requirements:**
- Must work at 2480x520px (ultra-wide)
- Important elements should be in safe zone (avoid extreme edges)
- Text should be readable at banner size
- High contrast for visibility
- Maintain brand colors (cold blue, warm amber, industrial gray)

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Dark gray (#1a1f2e, #2d3e50)
- Cold blue: (#1a75ff, #4a9eff)
- Warm amber: (#f4a300, #ff8800)
- White: (#ffffff) for text/accents

**Typography (if included):**
- Geometric sans-serif (Eurostile, Bank Gothic, DIN)
- High contrast (white on dark)
- Large enough to read in banner format

---

## My Recommendation

**Start with Option 1 (Industrial Landscape with Text)**

It gives you:
- Full atmospheric visual
- Brand name prominently displayed
- Lighting split that matches your concept
- Professional banner aesthetic
- Works great at 2480x520

If text doesn't render well in Nano Banana, fall back to **Option 3 (Pure Industrial)** and add text in Photoshop/Figma after.

---

## Post-Generation

If text needs to be added manually:
- Import banner into Figma/Photoshop
- Add "DOTPRODUKT" in Eurostile/Bank Gothic
- Position left-third of banner
- White text with subtle shadow
- Optional: Add "EBM/FUTUREPOP" smaller on right
